# Linux Scripts <!-- omit in toc -->

A collection of useful scripts for Linux systems that I use.

- [Scripts](#scripts)
  - [install-script-manjaro.sh](#install-script-manjarosh)
  - [start-my-scripts.sh](#start-my-scriptssh)

## Scripts

### [install-script-manjaro.sh](install-script-manjaro.sh)

This script is designed to streamline the process of
setting up a fresh Manjaro installation.

It installs all the packages I prefer, making it easier for me to get started
with a new Manjaro environment.

### [start-my-scripts.sh](start-my-scripts.sh)

Originally used to initialize the projects I wanted to run on my home server (AlmaLinux),
this script has since been replaced by systemd and [pm2](https://pm2.io/).

While it may no longer be my preferred solution,
you can still explore its functionality and adapt it to your needs.
